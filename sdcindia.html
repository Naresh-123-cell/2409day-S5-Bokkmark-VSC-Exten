    <img alt="" src="./images/accenture.jpg" width="400px" height="400px" />
    <p>
      Accenture plc is an Irish-American professional services company
      headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, that specializes in information
      technology (IT) services and consulting. A Fortune Global 500 company, it
      reported revenues of $64.1 billion in 2024. <br />Accenture began as the
      business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur
      Andersen in the early 1950s.The division conducted a feasibility study for
      General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville,
      Kentucky, which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and
      printer, believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the
      United States. <br />In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting
      became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Soci√©t√© Coop√©rative (AWSC).
      Throughout the 1990s, tensions grew between the two units. Andersen
      Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year
      (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit whether
      AA or AC, pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur
      Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly
      established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen
      Business Consulting. This dispute came to a head in 1998, when Andersen
      Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years
      into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and
      Arthur Andersen. In 2000, as a result of arbitration, Andersen Consulting
      broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the
      arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid $1.2 billion to Arthur
      Andersen and changed its name to Accenture. <br />On 1 January 2001,
      Andersen Consulting adopted the name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture"
      was derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was
      submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo,
      Norway office. Petersen felt that the name should represent the firm's
      desire to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also
      intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which
      Accenture operates, because the word itself was meaningless.
      <br />Accenture was incorporated in Bermuda in 2001. On 19 July 2001,
      Accenture's initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share,
      and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Because of the
      split from Andersen, Accenture avoided prosecution on June 16, 2002, when
      the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prosecuted Arthur Andersen for
      obstructing justice and accounting fraud.
